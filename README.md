## Introduction

The **Health Prediction System** leverages machine learning to analyze user data (e.g., symptoms, vitals, medical history) and predict potential health conditions. This tool aims to assist users in gaining a preliminary understanding of their health, empowering them to take informed decisions or seek medical advice.

### Use Cases:
- Symptom-based condition prediction.
- Chronic disease risk assessment.
- Preventive health recommendations.

**Note:** This tool is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

## Features

- Predict conditions based on user symptoms.
- Visualize risk factors and health metrics.
- Provide personalized health recommendations.
- Scalable and easy-to-use interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Scikit-learn
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualizations)
- **Framework**: Flask/Django (for web app, if applicable)
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, etc.
